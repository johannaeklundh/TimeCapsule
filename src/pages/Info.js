      <p>
        In this app you can create multiple Time Capsules to save photos in a
        fun way. When creating a capsule, choose your own name and between which
        days you want to upload photos. Photos can only be uploaded to the
        capsule between the start date and end date. When the time is up, photos
        can no longer be uploaded to the capsule. Photos that have been added
        can now be viewed! Enjoy making memories that last forever!
